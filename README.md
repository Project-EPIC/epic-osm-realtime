Epic OSM Realtime
=================

Processing a realtime stream of OpenStreetMap data can be considered similar to listening to / processing data from the Twitter Streaming API.

This repository demonstrates and implements different techniques for handling real-time OSM data.

### Planet-Stream by DevelopmentSeed
DevSeed has built [Blog post](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2015/09/28/whats-trending-osm/) to support collection and aggregation of editing statistics during Mapathons. [The repository is here](https://github.com/developmentseed/planet-stream). An example of what it can power is the [Missing Maps leaderboard page](http://www.missingmaps.org/leaderboards/#/missingmaps)
